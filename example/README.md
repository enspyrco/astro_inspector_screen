# example

## Running

Run the example with the "introspection-example" VS Code launch config
(or set a dart-define of "IN-APP-INTROSPECTION=true" in some other way).

## Targets

Only the macos target has been added, just because that's what I was
working on. To add another target you can use `flutter create`, eg. to
add the web target use:

```sh
flutter create --platforms web .
```
